Spotirec is a tool that allows you to create recommended playlists on your Spotify account.

Recommendations can follow one of two flows; automatic and custom. Each recommendation is based on a seed of at least one, and at most five tracks, artists, or genres.

#### Auto
Automatic flows will choose the top tracks, artists, or genres from your account. You will be prompted to select how many seeds should be included.

#### Custom
With custom flows you can define which tracks, artists, or genres should be included.
